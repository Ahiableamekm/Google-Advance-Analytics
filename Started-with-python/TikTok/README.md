# 2

Previously we complete a `PACE` strategy document and project proposal [Tiktok](../../DS-foundation/TikTok/). The proposal go a thumbs up and TikTok has given access to client data. The task is to Inspect and anlyze the data and provide answers to few questions raised during stakeholder meeting.

**The purpose** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided. This activity will:

1. Acquaint you with the data

2. Compile summary information about the data

3. Begin the process of EDA and reveal insights contained in the data

4. Prepare you for more in-depth EDA, hypothesis testing, and statistical analysis

**The goal** is to construct a dataframe in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of your findings.

This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: Understand the situation

How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided TikTok information?

**Part 2**: Understand the data

Create a pandas dataframe for data learning and future exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical activities

Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3**: Understand the variables

Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables
