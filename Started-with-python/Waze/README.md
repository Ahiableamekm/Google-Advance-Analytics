# 3

Previously we complete a `PACE` strategy document and project proposal [Tiktok](../../DS-foundation/waze/). The proposal go a thumbs up and Waze has given access to client data. The task is to Inspect and anlyze the data and provide answers to few questions raised during stakeholder meeting.

**The purpose** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.

**The goal** is to use a dataframe contructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.

*This activity has three parts:*

**Part 1:** Understand the situation

* How can you best prepare to understand and organize the provided information?

**Part 2:** Understand the data

* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities

* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps

**Part 3:** Understand the variables

* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into variables
