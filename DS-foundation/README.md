# The PACE workflow

Professionals rely on workflow structures to guide them through the duration of data projects. Within a large-scale project, there can be a number of tasks that require a certain order of operations. Identifying complexities and finding consistent ways to work together can make projects more efficient and enable more productive communication. Identifying these and other types of potential blockers early can help you plan and prepare resources in advance before they can negatively affect a project.
